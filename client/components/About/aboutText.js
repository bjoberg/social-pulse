const problem = "As more social media applications come about it has become challenging to keep all of your accounts consistent and up-to-date with your relevant information. Yes, it is possible to go through each one of your accounts and update your data manually, but it would be more efficient if you could make updates to everything with one application. Pulse will solve this problem by utilizing existing social media API’s to update and regulate all of your account data.";
const solution = "The main goal of this project is to create one application that keeps all of a user’s data consistent across their social media platforms. As noted before, Pulse will utilize existing API’s to regulate user data across accounts. Along with data regulation, some other features (stretch goals) that could be implemented is as follows. Graphs and other data visualizations that show key trends within your different social media accounts (ex: # of followers or likes per day). Tool that helps create one post that goes to all of your different social media accounts (ex: post and image to instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook at the same time). We are aware that there are many social media analytic tools available today. This idea does not come from the belief that this is going to be a completely new product, but the fact that we (and hopefully you:)) have always wanted to build a data analytic dashboard. Through this application we will gain experience accessing and manipulating data through existing API’s (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, 500px, etc...), have fun creating relevant and interactive data visualizations, utilize cutting edge web technologies (such as Angular 2 or React.js), and practice good UI / UX techniques.";
const customer = "In general, the customer of this application can be any individual or company who has more than one social media account. For CS 506 the specific customer will be any local business or individual. The business/individual is not currently set and will be selected by the group if this idea is selected.";
const testing = "High level testing will be done by creating “fake” social media accounts that will only be managed by our dashboarding tool. Low level testing will be done by comparing the values of each social media site and making them consistent throughout.";
const justification = "This idea became an ideal project for a team of 6-8 students because of its scalability (30+ different social media sites today). Along with its scalability this project requires many different components to be successful. Some team members worked on data handling, others worked on UI/UX, and also on security because we are handling personal data. For these reasons, we believe this project posed a challenge and required a diverse set of skills to be successful.";
